# Developers Who Blog

Welcome! This is a collection of blogs that I am currently following and tracking. 

Do you or someone you know write about software engineering and want to share it? [Open an issue to tell me about it!](https://github.com/brittanyellich/developers-who-blog/issues/new?template=add-a-suggestion-to-the-list.md)

## RSS Utilities

I added a small utility to log `/feed subscribe {link}` commands for folks that are interested in adding each of these feeds to Slack. I'm sure there are other and better tools for RSS Feeds, but Slack is my favorite one. 

To run the utility, do the following:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run slack`
4. Take each `/feed subscribe {link}` command (ex. `/feed subscribe https://brittanyellich.com/index.xml`) and copy it into your channel of choice
